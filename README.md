This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Achilles Dabrowski, Caleb Sanford, Cemal Yagcioglu

### Timeline

Start Date: 25th January, 2020.

Finish Date: 3rd February, 2020.

Hours Spent: 80 

### Primary Roles
Caleb Sanford: all View classes

### Resources Used
For exception class, got help from BrowserException.java from browser project.
For saving Xml File as output, got help from https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-create-xml-file-in-java-dom/.

### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: 
- View/ViewResources/English.properties
- Controller/resources/Colors.properties
- Controller/resources/ControllerExceptionMessages.properties
- Controller/resources/SimulationConfiguration.properties
- resources/<USER CREATED>.xml

Features implemented:
- Simulation
- Controller
- Visualizer
    - Display Hex and Square Grids
    - Display a graph of stats about the populations of all of the "kinds" of cells over the time of the simulation
    - Allow users to interact with the simulation dynamically to create or change a state at a grid location



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Interesting data files:

Known Bugs:
- Error Handling
- New Tree in Spreading Fire Simulation
- 

Extra credit:
- XML python generator


### Impressions

Caleb: This project allowed me to learn a lot about coding 
with a group. Overall a good experience.
