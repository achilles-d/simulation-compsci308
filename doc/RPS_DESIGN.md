## Possible Designs
We discussed creating a Player class to represent the play that the player makes.
Depending on what play is made, either an instance of the Rock, Paper, or Scissors
child class will be created. We when then create a Game class that would allow
and instance of each player to be made and, depending on which play each player made,
would decide a winner. If there were multiple (more than two) players, then 
players would be randomly assigned to each other such that only one-on-one games would be
played. Then, the winners would be randomly assigned to the other game winners and so 
on and so forth until one winner emerged over all players.
