* We need to focus on the following: 
### 1 - magic variables - there were some in Achilles and Caleb's code
### 2 - method length: Caleb's GridAnimator.makeCellArray() should be split into several methods
### 3 - refactor the case switch method (readParamsAndInitialize) in Controller class 
### 4 - simplify / consolidate control statements in Achilles's Grid subclasses
